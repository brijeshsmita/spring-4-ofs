	Inversion of Control	Do not allow dependent classes to
				build their dependencies.
		1. Dependency Injection:	Build all dependencies FIRST
						and INJECT them (Constructor/Setter)
						into Dependent Object
		2. Dependency Lookup: 		Build all depedencies and register
						them as discoverable service
					let dependent object locate and use it.
